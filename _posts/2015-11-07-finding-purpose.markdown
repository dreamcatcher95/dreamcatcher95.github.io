<p>We have always been drilled to build and keep up with a schedule. Write down our plans, carry them out, and stay on track. In elementary school we had agenda books and in our careers we keep a calendar or die trying. I'm a huge fan of keeping track of time, it guides me and keeps me on track. But lately my calendar has been falling apart. I've dedicated unknown amounts of time to personal projects. Some time here, some time there. Unfortunately I've also not finished a project in some time now. I've got a pair of speakers laying around, a website half built, and a startup left on simmer. This made me think, should I start building these things into my schedule? And I've found my answer.</p>

<p>So there are two sides to this coin. Hopefully by the end of this reflection we can land right on the middle. Find balance.</p>

<p>The first side, monotony. I've already discussed normalcy <a href="https://dreamcatcher95.github.io/dreamcatcher/2015/10/25/normalcy/" target="_blank"> here</a>. And the same applies, when things become automated we feel like a cog in a machine. As Khalil Gibran put it, "a reed, dumb and silent". Too much rigor in our time can be a terrible thing. We need to transcend time in this case. To find meaning in the things we do. Eventually we reach the question, what is the purpose of life. And the answer is dynamic, it depends on who, when, where, and how you ask someone.</p>

<p>Life is far too grand for my simple mind. So I'll tighten the frame of reference. What is the purpose of my month? This is usually something I can answer given a couple of minutes of reflection. If that is too grand of a question feel free to tighten the frame even more. I actually think we should tighten that frame constantly through our day. By asking ourselves what our purpose is it renews our intention. Keeps our actions in check. And once we keep reminding ourselves of our intention and purpose our actions will begin to mean much more. Early mornings are the gateway to a beautiful day. Late nights are the tunnels to a bright future. One thing I found to be helpful is to add a note to every item to your agenda, what is the end goal of this event. Usually helps to keep our intentions in check.</p>

<p>Now on the flip side, when I don't plan and just take things as they come. I've tried this method at certain points in my life, usually not by choice. I just get so overwhelmed with work and school and family that I can't track them all. It's tough to give things purpose when you aren't even sure what those things are. Being in this state of mind is always nerve-wrecking, I never know what I miss.</p>

<p>At these stages it's  a good idea to wipe the dust off your agenda. Divide your time into general sections; work, personal care, cooking, family time. You can block off larger portions of time that are easier to manage. The categories can even be somewhat vague so you can sneak things in. Eventually you want to start adding more categories and defining your time in a stricter manner. The significance of intention is just as important here. Set goals for your categories, even if they are broader. What do you want to get out of that project at work? What do you want to do for your wife on her birthday? These will help steer yourself towards what you want to get done, rather than getting slammed with random events and tasks.</p>

<p>On one side of our coin we have a rigid schedule where we lose track of purpose. On the other side life is just a blur and chaos. The best way to find a balance is to assign purpose and intention to whatever we do, whether it's planned or not. Certain things demand detailed planning, like reports for work. While others can allow for more general goals implemented over time, like working on your car. At the end of the day it is all about adding finesse to our time and finding our purpose.</p>
