<p>Alif-Lam-Meem, no one knows what it means. Yet, every taraweeh prayer today started off with it. There is not a single person who doubts its certainty, Alif-Lam-Meem. Pray we are among the pious the Quran mentions few lines later, those who believe in the unseen. In this case we believe in something we don't fully understand. But this is Islam, we submit. Submit to the greatest knowledge of Allah. </p>

<p>Sure I don't understand those three letters, but Allah has prescribed it to us. Allah's wisdom and knowledge supersedes all. So does his control over every breath I take. Which reminds us that we aren’t always capable of seeing His wisdom in our daily lives. Shouldn't be vain when things don't go as planned, He is the greatest of planners.</p>

<p>We need to learn to let go to the unseen. Alif-Lam-Meem.</p>
