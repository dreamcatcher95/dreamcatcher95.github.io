<p>A lot of times people are faced with hardships. Bills, medical expenses, educational expenses, living expenses, etc. We get caught in this cycle of making money and trying to spend it in the best way possible. What we see as a good investment. Unfortunately, a majority of our society spends so much time trying to make an investment to maintain the present that they can't invest in their future. Hence, living from paycheck to paycheck. But how many of us actually realize that there are still people in our own country starving and dying from hunger? The homeless guy at the corner at the Subway is an isolated case, he made bad life decisions. Or not?</p>

<p>We are so busy CONSUMING our money, that we forget all about the people and events around us. Classic bread and circus. But we don't realize it cause its fancy dinners and television now. A majority of us live in a cave. A cave with a nice shadow that we like to see flicker in the light. (reference to plato's allegory of the cave).</p>

<p>A majority of us think we are climbing uphill, like a hamster on a wheel, but we aren't moving anywhere. We save money to spend it, we spend money to...well, why do we spend it. Good investments. Maybe we just all need to take a step back and just be grateful and thankful for the things that we can't decide to invest in. No matter how much money you pour into your life, one day, you'll stop breathing. No matter how often you workout and jog, your heart will stop beating. No matter how long you spend studying for a test, your brain will go out.</p>

<p>This is kinda dark, but we all live in a dark world. It's time to blow out the candle, get up, and open a window and let real light come into our lives. Start living in a state of thankfulness and soon those good investments will become the best investments. Or maybe we'll realize that money can't possibly invest in the most important things in life.</p>
