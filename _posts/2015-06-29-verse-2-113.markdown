<h1 style="text-align:right">وَقَالَتْ الْيَهُودُ لَيْسَتْ النَّصَارَى عَلَى شَيْءٍ وَقَالَتْ النَّصَارَى لَيْسَتْ الْيَهُودُ عَلَى شَيْءٍ وَهُمْ يَتْلُونَ الْكِتَابَ كَذَلِكَ قَالَ الَّذِينَ لاَ يَعْلَمُونَ مِثْلَ قَوْلِهِمْ فَاللَّهُ يَحْكُمُ بَيْنَهُمْ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ فِيمَا كَانُوا فِيهِ يَخْتَلِفُونَ</h1>

<blockquote>"And the Jews have said, 'The Nasara (i.e. the Christians) do not (stand) on anything,' and the Nasara have said, 'The Jews do not (stand) on anything,' and they recite the Book. Thus the ones who do not know have said the like of their saying. So, Allah will judge between them on the Day of the Resurrection wherein they used to differ."</blockquote>

<p>Oftentimes we find ourselves lost in mindless arguments with people, afterwards unable to even remember how it even began. Other times we spend so much time criticizing others that we forget to look at ourselves. This ayah highlights the importance of self-reflection.</p>

<p>Allah shows us two groups of people, the Jews and Christians. Both pointing fingers at each other, proclaiming that the other has diverted from the truth. But in this same ayah Allah reminds us that it is only He who makes that judgment. In fact there is a third party who isn’t Jewish or Christian and say that they both do not follow the truth. This is amazing since Atheism wasn’t very prominent during the time of the Prophet ﷺ. But Allah shows us here of people who have no knowledge of the Books.</p>

<p>This ayah reminds me to be very careful and diligent before even thinking about correcting someone or passing judgment. Only God knows best. As flawed humans we can, and should, only turn to ourselves if we want to criticize faults. I know for a fact I have way too many to count. Pray that God overlooks them on the Day of Judgment.</p>
